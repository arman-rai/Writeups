They seem to use port-based traffic classification, deep packet inspection (DPI), and statistical and machine learning techniques and also IP address and service blocklisting.
P2P uses certain ports and protocols that can easily be filtered at the client level. That is,  for example: the ProtonVPN client (the software you install on you computer or phone) can determine if you're using P2P without Proton (the company) having to know or monitor anything.

A peer-to-peer network enables users to transmit and receive data across the network through several nodes rather than a single place because every member or peer acts as a potential point of connection. In this way, data can be transferred from numerous sources, resulting in quicker and more effective downloads.
Similarly, a P2P VPN connects users directly while also encrypting the data they send to each other.

P2P traffic does not use a single, standardized port; instead, it uses a wide range of ports that can be specific to the application or dynamically assigned. Common examples include the BitTorrent range of ports 6881-6999, and ports used by applications like Steam (e.g., 3478, 4379, 4380)
