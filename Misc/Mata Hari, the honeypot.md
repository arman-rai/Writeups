For example, a honeypot could mimic a company's customer billing system - a frequent target of attack for criminals who want to find credit card numbers. Once the hackers are in, they can be tracked, and their behavior assessed for clues on how to make the real network more secure.

Some honeypot traps
**Email traps** or spam traps place a fake email address in a hidden location where only an automated address harvester will be able to find it and in reality the email isn't really used.  The source IP of the senders can be added to a denylist.

A **malware honeypot** mimics software apps and APIs to invite malware attacks, so basically the hackers are unpaid researchers. Then after honeypot is pwned, we can basically reverse engineer and make a more secure software.

A **spider honeypot** is intended to trap webcrawlers ('spiders') by creating web pages and links only accessible to crawlers. Detecting crawlers can help you learn how to block malicious bots, as well as ad-network crawlers.

A **decoy database** can be set up to monitor software vulnerabilities and spot attacks exploiting insecure system architecture or using SQL injection, SQL services exploitation, or privilege abuse.
