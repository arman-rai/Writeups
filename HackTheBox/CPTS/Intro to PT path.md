###  The Penetration Tester Path: Memory Cheat Sheet

#### 1. The Core Philosophy
*   **"Learn by Doing":** This is not about clicking buttons; it is about understanding the **"Why"**.
*   **The Goal:** Build a repeatable methodology and "muscle memory" so you can handle the basics without thinking—saving brainpower for the hard stuff.
*   **The Mindset:** See both sides of the coin (Attacker vs. Defender) to find flaws others miss.

#### 2. The Golden Rule: Ethics & Law 
*   **Consent is King:** Never scan or probe a system without **explicit written permission** (a signed Scope of Work).
*   **The Line:** Passive OSINT (Googling/public info) is **OK**. Active scanning (touching their servers) is **Illegal** without consent.
*   **Do No Harm:** You are a guest in their network. Don't crash their servers.
*   **Verify Your Boss:** Criminals sometimes pose as "pentesting companies." Ensure you have a contract and the target is aware.
*   **When in Doubt:** **Document** everything and ask. Don't go out of scope.

#### 3. The Journey (Module Breakdown)
The path follows the story of a simulated attack on a company called **"Inlanefreight."** Here are the 28 modules grouped by phase:

**Phase I: The Setup**
*   *Intro & Getting Started*

**Phase II: The Hunt (Recon & Enum)**
*   *Nmap, Footprinting, Web Info Gathering, Vuln Assessment*

**Phase III: The Breach (Weaponizing)**
*   *File Transfers, Shells, Metasploit, Password Attacks, Common Services, Active Directory, Pivoting/Tunneling*

**Phase IV: The Web Frontier**
*   *Web Proxies, Ffuf, Brute Forcing, SQL Injection (SQLMap), XSS, File Uploads, Command Injection*

**Phase V: The Climb (Privilege Escalation)**
*   *Linux PrivEsc, Windows PrivEsc*

**Phase VI: The Closeout**
*   *Reporting & Documentation*
*   **The Capstone:** A full-blown mock exam where you run the whole show.

#### 4. Keys to Success
*   **Start Here:** If you are new, begin with the **"Information Security Foundations"** path first.
*   **Stay in Order:** The concepts build on each other (Lego style).
*   **Specialize Later:** Finish this general path first, then pick a niche (AD, Web, etc.).
